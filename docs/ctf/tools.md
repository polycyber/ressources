Un CTF se passe mieux avec les bons outils.

* **[CTF Tools](https://github.com/zardus/ctf-tools)**: *This is a collection of setup scripts to create an install of various security research tools. Of course, this isn't a hard problem, but it's really nice to have them in one place that's easily deployable to new machines and so forth.*
* **[Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org)** *Kali Linux is an open-source, Debian-based Linux distribution geared towards various information security tasks, such as Penetration Testing, Security Research, Computer Forensics and Reverse Engineering.*
* **[CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/)** *CyberChef is a simple, intuitive web app for carrying out all manner of "cyber" operations within a web browser. These operations include simple encoding like XOR and Base64, more complex encryption like AES, DES and Blowfish, creating binary and hexdumps, compression and decompression of data, calculating hashes and checksums, IPv6 and X.509 parsing, changing character encodings, and much more.*
