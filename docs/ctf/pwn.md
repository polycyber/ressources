# Exploitation de fichiers binaires (pwn)

Identifier et exploiter des failles dans des programmes binaires (comme les dépassements de tampon ou l'exploitation de pointeurs) pour obtenir un accès ou exécuter du code arbitraire.

- [pwnable.kr](https://pwnable.kr/): *'pwnable.kr' is a non-commercial wargame site which provides various pwn challenges regarding system exploitation. the main purpose of pwnable.kr is 'fun'.    please consider each of the challenges as a game. But, if you want to just study pwn-related stuffs, check out the following video lectures.*
- [pwnable.tw](https://pwnable.tw/): Pwnable.tw is a wargame site for hackers to test and expand their binary exploiting skills.
- [pwn college](https://pwn.college/): *pwn.college is an education platform for students (and other interested parties) to learn about, and practice, core cybersecurity concepts in a hands-on fashion. In martial arts terms, it is designed to take a “white belt” in cybersecurity through the journey to becoming a “blue belt”, able to approach (simple) cybersecurity competitions (CTFs) and wargames. Our philosophy is “practice makes perfect”.*
- [ROP Emporium](https://ropemporium.com/): *Learn return-oriented programming through a series of challenges.*
- [Smash the stack](http://smashthestack.org/): *The Smash the Stack Wargaming Network is an ethical hacking environment that simulates real-world software vulnerabilities using challenges, which we call wargames. Each wargame allows learners from various backgrounds to test their knowledge, skills, and abilities in reverse engineering, web app pen-testing, software exploitation, and much more.*
- [How2Heap](https://github.com/shellphish/how2heap): *This repo is for learning various heap exploitation techniques. We use Ubuntu's Libc releases as the gold-standard. Each technique is verified to work on corresponding Ubuntu releases. You can run apt source libc6 to download the source code of the Libc your are using on Debian-based operating system. You can also click ▶️ to debug the technique in your browser using gdb.*
