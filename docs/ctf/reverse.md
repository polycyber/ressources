# Rétroingénierie logicielle

Analyser des exécutables ou des binaires pour comprendre leur fonctionnement interne. Les participants doivent désassembler, décompiler et déchiffrer le code pour trouver le drapeau.

- [Github - Hustcw/Angr_Tutorial_For_CTF](https://github.com/Hustcw/Angr_Tutorial_For_CTF): *angr is a very useful binary analysis framework. Many ctfers like using angr to save their time in CTF. However angr is a little bit difficult for beginners as its update from version 7 to version 8. And many great tutorials for angr in CTF can't work well. I use this git repo to record my learning experience for angr based on this fantasic tutorial angr_ctf, angr Documentation and angr API documentation. Many thanks to them. And I hope that I can keep going for some time and being familiar with angr in the future.*
